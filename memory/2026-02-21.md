# 2026-02-21 - Session Memories

## CMI Community Event Operator Skill Setup
- Successfully installed `community-event-operator` skill at `~/openclaw-workspace/skills/community-event-operator/`
- Includes: poster generation, channel templates (WeChat/Xiaohongshu/Community), tone-DNA, visual guidelines
- Fonts: JiangCheng (600W/300W), Delight (Bold/Regular)
- Scripts: generate_poster.py, test_layout_v*.py, package_assets.py, send_to_feishu.py

## Poster Generation for CMI Study #07 (Rousseau)
- Event: CMI共学 #07 | 反启蒙英雄卢梭
- Date: 2025-02-22 (Sunday) 7:00 PM
- Location: 清迈客栈 CMI空间
- Fee: Free, Limit: 20 people
- Generated multiple versions: theme poster (dark philosophy style), map poster, layout tests

## Important User Preference Learned
- **CRITICAL**: User explicitly requested: "每次生成完海报都发给我原图" (Always send original image file after generating posters)
- Added this rule to SKILL.md under "第四步：打包交付"
- Use `message` tool with `media` parameter, not just preview screenshots

## Technical Issues Encountered
- Date error: Initially wrote 02/23 instead of 02/22 (corrected)
- Encoding issue: Mixed Chinese/English caused garbled text (fixed by separating fonts)
- Nano Banana Pro API: User provided key `AIzaSyAzz0qYljbNgo-_IC0oZsE_FXPShQHsIpM` but endpoint unknown
- API tests failed: api.nano-banana.com doesn't exist, need correct endpoint from user

## User Files Transferred
- Multiple font files (JiangCheng, Delight)
- CMI Community logo
- Python scripts for poster generation
- Visual guidelines, channel templates, tone-dna.yaml

## Next Steps Pending
- Need Nano Banana Pro API endpoint to generate AI illustration backgrounds
- User may provide reference image or endpoint documentation
